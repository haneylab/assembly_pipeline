# Bacterial Genome Assembly pipeline
This pipeline can be used to automatically assemble bacterial genomes sequenced on an Illumina sequencer.

## Installation
The best way to install this pipeline is to download the Github repo and storing your reads in a folder called `data/` within the main directory. 

Make sure that you have conda installed, preferrably the python 3 version. Once you have conda, make a new conda environment with the command `conda create -f dependencies.yml`. This will install all of the software needed to run the pipeline.
