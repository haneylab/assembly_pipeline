# Bacterial Genome Assembly pipeline
This pipeline can be used to automatically assemble bacterial genomes sequenced on an Illumina sequencer.

## Installation
Ensure that you have a recent version of conda installed on your computer. I recommend the Python 3.7 version of Miniconda which you can install [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Once you have conda, navigate to this repo in your command line and make a new conda environment with the command `conda env create -f dependencies.yml`. This will install all of the software needed to run the pipeline.
